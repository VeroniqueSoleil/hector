# Sequence Diagrams
   > Now I'm going to use md to make sequence diagrams
   
   > At first, I will follow the [examples](http://bramp.github.io/js-sequence-diagrams/)
   
   > After I can handle it well, I will make some new sequence diagrams \(planing to use it to reflect some theories from Robert Mackee) 

## Examples as follows:

   ```seq
   Alice->Bob: How are u
   Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
   Bob-->Alice: Fine, thanks
   ```
  Tried in the [Cmd Markdown编辑器](https://www.zybuluo.com), IT WORKS.
